//function(occamsfuncer){
	
	//var λ = ...imported from occamsfuncer.js
	
	var occamsfuncerTools = TODO use the λ (imported from occamsfuncer.js) universalFunc to create
	a treemap of string to function (BTW treemap and string are both functions made of occamsfuncer, even if they wrap actual strings etc).
	This will keep the namespace clean by having only those 2 things in it: occamsfuncer and occamsfuncerTools,
	plus whatever other stuff people want to put into it, but soon we should develop a way of distributing and storing
	the occamsfuncer funcs as the merkle forest instead of putting them in js files,
	or could store their binary form in the js files like a map of id to the fields in CallQuad.java (or am I just naming it Call.java or Quad.java?).
	
	//return occamsfuncerTools;
	
	//TODO nodejs export style?
