/** This is the core object type in occamsfuncer. Using the lambda symbol (Î») cuz
its a universal lambda function and pattern calculus function. (renamed from fn.java)
Theres an immutable layer of all possible functions, with an optional mutable/NondetNode layer above them for efficiency.
Only the immutable functions are shared on internet cuz they never have errors nor state to sync.
This is a function or snapshot of stack state during eval. Stack state costs bigO(1) per step. Data is made of functions,
such as complete binary tree of pairs of T or F padded with T then 0 or more F up to next powOf2, is a bitstring.
T is the lambda Lx.Ly.x, and F is the lambda Lx.Ly.y.
All functions are made of combos of the universal function aka leaf, which has 15 params, described in occamsfuncerSpec.txt.
Can wrap arrays in a function, such as double[] int[] FloatBuffer for efficiency.
Wrapped objects must still have usable L(), R(), and lambda functions,
plus in some cases they can be used in combo with other optimizations directly as arrays.
Wrapped objects normally use lazy dedup, but if you get an id on them (from any idMaker func) everything dedups exactly,
such as happens when used as a map key.
